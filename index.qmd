Thank you for your interest in this course. Your course instructor [Lars Schöbitz](https://ghe.ethz.ch/about/people/person-detail.MjkyODc2.TGlzdC80MTI2LC0xNDYwMDMwNTU3.html) is looking forward to meet you. 

We will meet on Zoom at the following times:

-   **Day 1:** 03 April 2024 - 12:00 noon to 14:00 pm CET
-   **Day 2:** 10 April 2024 - 12:00 noon to 14:00 pm CET

Please ensure you have the following available:

-   a laptop, connected to wifi
-   a browser installation on your laptop that is not the Internet Explorer

This course uses participatory live coding techniques and [it is advantageous to have a second screen available]{.highlight-yellow}. One screen can be used to watch the Zoom meeting and the other screen can be used to follow along with the live coding.

[Prior to Day 1, there is some pre-work for you to do]{.highlight-yellow}. This pre-work will ensure that we can focus our time together on learning instead of setting up infrastructure.
